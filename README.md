# digifab-datathon

This repo holds our entry to the [Digifab / Faculty of Natural Sciences datathon][datathon] held on the 24th od March 2021. Our team consisted of [Tom][Tom], [Milan][Milan], [Peru][Peru], [Gino][Gino] and [Chris][Chris] all PhD students in the [Condensed Matter Theory Group][CMTH] at [Imperial College London][ICL].

We won the datathon with [scikit-learn][Sklearn] by focussing on back-to-basics (Linear regression and Random Forest) models that were quick to train and iterate on.
